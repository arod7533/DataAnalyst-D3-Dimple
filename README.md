<h1>Data Visualization of the Survivorship on the Titanic</h1>

<strong>Summary:</strong> This data visualization was created using D3.js and Dimple.js. The dataset is a list of passengers from the Titanic and their specific
characteristics. This visualization shows a count of passengers by class and sex, and if they survived or not. It is extremely interesting to discover that, by far, females survived more than males. 96.8% of First class female passengers survived, 92.1% of Second class female passengers survived, and with a big drop off, only 50% of Third class female passengers survived. Of the males, 36.8% of First class male passengers survived, 15.7% of Second class male passengers survived, and 13.5% of Third class male passengers survived. If you were lucky enough to be one of the First class passengers on the Titanic, your chances of survival were much higher. 





<strong>Design:</strong> I created a stacked bar chart with passenger count on the y-axis and categorized the bar charts on the x-axis by passenger class and sex. I added a color category for survival to show how many passengers survived or did not survive. 


<strong>Feedback:</strong>
				<br>1) I was told that the scatter plot did not help the viewer visualize each data point. The points were too small and you could barely see the color. I changed it to a bar chart. 
				<br>2) I was told that the heading was too small (I originall used h2) and that I should make it bigger to clearly indicate the topic of the visualization. 
				<br>3) After showing version 1.0 of my visualization to a friend, they told me that I should re-think how I was charting the data. They said that the horizontal bar chart made it difficult to understand what point I was trying to make. They advised that I should start from scratch and try to simplify my message. I rethought the visualization and decided to create a stacked bar chart.
				<br>4) I was told that I should change the color of the 'Survived' from red to green and 'Did Not Survive' from blue to red, since red is more asthetically associated to not surviving. 
				<br>5) I was told that the gridlines were distracting to the overall message of the visualization and that I should remove them. 
				<br> I was told to change the chart title from "Males/Females who Survived/Did Not Survive by Class" to something a little simpler but that still described the visualization. I changed it to "Titanic: Male/Female Survival Rate by Passenger Class"
