<h1>Data Visualization of the Survivorship on the Titanic</h1>

<strong>Summary:</strong> This data visualization was created using D3.js and Dimple.js. The dataset is a list of passengers from the Titanic and their specific
characteristics. The visualization illustrates the most important chracteristic of a passenger, in my opinion, and if they survived the shipwreck. 
<br>
<strong>Design:</strong> The scatter plot visualization was made with the x-axis showing the ages of each passenger, the y axis showing the passenger's class, and the ground
 and each passenger was grouped by color if they survived (green) or not (red).
