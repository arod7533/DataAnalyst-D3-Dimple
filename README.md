<h1>Data Visualization of the Survivorship on the Titanic</h1>

<strong>Summary:</strong> This data visualization was created using D3.js and Dimple.js. The dataset is a list of passengers from the Titanic and their specific
characteristics. The visualization illustrates the most important chracteristic of a passenger, in my opinion, and if they survived the shipwreck. 


<strong>Design:</strong> The scatter plot visualization was made with the x-axis showing the ages of each passenger, the y axis showing the passenger's class, and the ground
 and each passenger was grouped by color if they survived (green) or not (red). 


<strong>Feedback:</strong>
				<br>1) I was told that the scatter plot did not help the viewer visualize each data point. The points were too small and you could barely see the color. I changed it to a bar chart. 
				<br>2) I was told that the heading was too small (I originall used h2) and that I should make it bigger to clearly indicate the topic of the visualization. 
				<br>3) Apparently the 'Did Not Survive' grouping has two different shades of red. I have not been able to figure out how to fix this. Once you notice, it is difficult to look at the visualization without immediately noticing.
